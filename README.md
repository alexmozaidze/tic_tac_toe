# Rusty Tic-Tac-Toe

A ridiculously simple Tic-Tac-Toe game written in Rust.
Rendering is done with PixEngine, which is cool, but for some reason it uses up 100% of one of my
cores 24/7 while drawing, but it doesn't matter tbh.

## Building

Execute following code in the scary black window of characters known as "terminal" in order to
launch the game.

```sh
cargo run --release
```

It should work on Linux because I tested on Linux, it might work on Windows but
I didn't test it on Windows, and Mac.. Uh, I don't have that much money, I'd rather get myself
a chocolate cake.

## Motivation

Because

## Crab

As promised: ðŸ¦€
